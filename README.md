## Key Features

- Compliant with [Section 4.1](https://www.w3.org/TR/indieauth/#discovery-by-clients) and [Section 4.2.2](https://www.w3.org/TR/indieauth/#redirect-url) of [the W3C's IndieAuth Working Group Note](https://www.w3.org/TR/indieauth/), [Section 5.3](https://www.w3.org/TR/micropub/#endpoint-discovery) of [the W3C's Micropub Recommendation](https://www.w3.org/TR/micropub/), and [Section 3.1.2](https://www.w3.org/TR/webmention/#sender-discovers-receiver-webmention-endpoint) of [the W3C's Webmention Recommendation](https://www.w3.org/TR/webmention/).
- Passes all Endpoint Discovery tests on [webmention.rocks](https://webmention.rocks).
- Supports Ruby 2.7 and newer.

## Getting Started

Before installing and using indieweb-endpoints-ruby, you'll want to have [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org) 2.7 (or newer) installed. It's recommended that you use a Ruby version managment tool like [rbenv](https://github.com/rbenv/rbenv), [chruby](https://github.com/postmodern/chruby), or [rvm](https://github.com/rvm/rvm).

indieweb-endpoints-ruby is developed using Ruby 2.7.6 and is additionally tested against Ruby 3.0 and 3.1 using [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/indieweb/indieweb-endpoints-ruby/actions).

## Installation

If you're using [Bundler](https://bundler.io), add indieweb-endpoints-ruby to your project's `Gemfile`:

```ruby
source 'https://rubygems.org'

gem 'indieweb-endpoints'
```

…and hop over to your command prompt and run…

```sh
$ bundle install
```

## Usage

### Basic Usage

With indieweb-endpoints-ruby added to your project's `Gemfile` and installed, you may discover a URL's IndieWeb-relevant endpoints by doing:

```ruby
require 'indieweb/endpoints'

IndieWeb::Endpoints.get('https://aaronparecki.com')
#=> { authorization_endpoint: "https://aaronparecki.com/auth", "indieauth-metadata": "https://aaronparecki.com/.well-known/oauth-authorization-server", micropub: "https://aaronparecki.com/micropub", microsub: "https://aperture.p3k.io/microsub/1", redirect_uri: nil, token_endpoint: "https://aaronparecki.com/auth/token", webmention: "https://webmention.io/aaronpk/webmention" }
```

This example will search `https://aaronparecki.com` for valid IndieAuth, Micropub, and Webmention endpoints and return a `Hash` of results. Each key in the returned `Hash` will have a value of either a `String` representing a URL or `nil`. The `redirect_uri` key's value will be either an `Array` or `nil` since a given URL may register multiple callback URLs.

### Advanced Usage

Should the need arise, you may work with the `IndieWeb::Endpoints::Client` class:

```ruby
require 'indieweb/endpoints'

client = IndieWeb::Endpoints::Client.new('https://aaronparecki.com')
#=> #<IndieWeb::Endpoints::Client uri: "https://aaronparecki.com">

client.response
#=> #<HTTP::Response/1.1 200 OK {…}>

client.endpoints
#=> { authorization_endpoint: "https://aaronparecki.com/auth", micropub: "https://aaronparecki.com/micropub", microsub: "https://aperture.p3k.io/microsub/1", redirect_uri: nil, token_endpoint: "https://aaronparecki.com/auth/token", webmention: "https://webmention.io/aaronpk/webmention" }
```

### Exception Handling

There are several exceptions that may be raised by indieweb-endpoints-ruby's underlying dependencies. These errors are raised as subclasses of `IndieWeb::Endpoints::Error` (which itself is a subclass of `StandardError`).

## Acknowledgments

indieweb-endpoints-ruby wouldn't exist without IndieAuth, Micropub, and Webmention and the hard work put in by everyone involved in the [IndieWeb](https://indieweb.org) movement. Additionally, the comprehensive Webmention Endpoint Discovery test suite at [webmention.rocks](https://webmention.rocks) was invaluable in the development of this Ruby gem.
